# The state of world happiness in 2019

Happiness is what we seek. It makes sense to understand what are the factors that affect the state of happiness all over the world. 

In this project, I try answering this question by working on the data provided by "The World Happiness Report".

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

Some of the questions I address in this project:

- Who are the happiest people in 2019?
- Who are the least happy people in 2019?
- The Happiness Distribution in 2019
- What influences happiness?

Finally, I build a predictive model that predicts the happiness score for a specific country, given its scores in happiness affecting factors.
